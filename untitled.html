<div>Epidemiology is the study of distribution and determinants of diseases and health related states in populations and use of that knowledge in order to prevent illnesses and promote health of populations (cite??). The word "Epidemiology" is derived from "Epi" = upon, "demo" = population, and "logos" = discourse. Thus, from its source, Epidemiology would mean that it is the study of everything that is related to&nbsp;populations. Within the larger field of Epidemiology, environmental epidemiology is &nbsp;a branch where the exposure variables are present in our environment. For example, if you were to conduct an epidemiological investigation of the relationship between air pollution and asthma, then this would be an environmental epidemiological study. Similarly, if you were to conduct a study on tassociatoin association between job stress and hypertension or diabetes, then this kind of study would be labelled as occupational epidemiological study.&nbsp;</div><div>In this module, we will cover Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology along the following sequence:</div><ul><li>causality,&nbsp;and causal inference&nbsp;</li><li>measures in Epidemiology</li><li>epidemiological study designs</li><li>how to design epidemiological studies</li><li>how to analyse epidemiological data</li></ul><div>We will focus on environmental factors as risk factors or exposures.&nbsp;</div><div>Imagine an elderly woman slipping on an icy street and breaking her hip. What do you think would be the cause?</div><div>Sufficient causes are those models which incorporate a number of different possible causes within the same model and all component causes interact with each other. The causes interact with each other and result in the outcome that we discuss. The causes however, do not need to interact all at the same time.</div><div>// Sufficient causal models here</div><div>Figure 1. Sufficient causal models. Note how component causes, sufficient causal models, and necessary causes are illustrated in this model</div><div>Causal thinking is part of being human and most people have a notion of one-one notion of .cause and effect. According to Rothman (2014), an infant, for example, cries in order to get milk or attention from his or her mother and this is an example of an early formation of our caus thinking (citation??). Likewise, when a boy grows up, he thinks that the flipping of the switch _causes_ the bulb to glow. However, as we have</div><div>Causal thinking grew out of a long history. Initially, people used to rely on the words of the wise people. Hippocrates was an early era physician who also introduced the concept of environment and the need for accurate history &nbsp;</div><div>Inductive thinking was the next step. Here, from particular events or facts, the scientist would deduce generalisable truths. For example,&nbsp;</div><div>In about 1700s, a new line of thinking emerged, referred to as "deductive thinking" and falsification of hypothesis. David Hume and others argued that inductive logicians assumed that the initial conditions of inductive logic remained invariant. For example,</div><div>In falsification of hypothesis, we would start with a theory and then formulate a hypothesis. Instead of finding out facts to further substantiate my theory, we would look for counter-examples or examples or facts that would make the hypothesis wrong. For example, . If we are able to identify an example or an instance which refutes my theory, or a hypothesis derived from my theory, then that would disprove the theory itself. This would mean that we would have to search for another theory to explain the phenomenon.</div><div>The Vienna school of philosopher, Karl Popper, who was also an academic at the University of Canterbury, in 1934, provided an extension of the falsification of the hypothesis.
